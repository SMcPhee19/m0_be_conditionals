# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- I feel good about my understanding of comparison operators. I've had some practice with things like this prior to today, It took a second to recall everything. After the two assignments in here, I feel pretty good.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- Logical operators felt good too. My only hiccups were syntax errors when combining them with else and elsif statements.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- Like above, felt good. Most of the errors came from easy to fix syntax errors like misspelling or forgeting "end" 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- I spent about an hour and a half on this which lined up with the two-ish hours I gave myself to do it.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I still need to practice making sure I don't make the silly mistakes. I will do that by making sure I take my time looking over my code.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I still wonder why if the answer to the statement is true/false, it is not required to enter the desired outcome in the and/or statement. There was a point when talking about the dog that I entered the ``puts loves_to_play == true && loves_dog_park == false`` and got a true output. The variables were assigned to ``loves_to_play = true loves_dog_park = false loves_treats = true age = 1`` when I removed the == ture and == false from the conditional the answer became what I needed it to be.  Do some learning and practicing outside of class, and ask questions in slack as I need to.
